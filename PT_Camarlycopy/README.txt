*Application and Software Requirements:
	*Python 3 installed
	*IDE with python configured

The same can be achieved from the command line. 

*PLEASE ENSURE THAT YOU UNZIP/UNPACK ALL THE DEPENDENCIES IN THE 'ASSETS' FOLDER.*
The assets folder is a requirement for the program to function


ANALYSIS 
--------

The user is asked to register for an account by filling out the registration form, the user should then proceed to login and access the members area. In the members are the user has a profile section, displaying the demographics provided during registration. The user has two options to access registered user content: 
	*The user can either use the file menu option located at the top or
	*click the buttons corresponding to the desired application or functions to launch. 


There are three main functions in this program:
1. Game (This is a console/command line only game - There is no GUI)
	*This is a simple hangman game that the registered user can play. 
2. The credit card application. 
	*Here the user can validate his/her credit card. 
3. A Donate button - registered users can make a donation to the named system.

TESTING & TROUBLESHOOTING
-------------------------
The program was tested to ensure most features are available. The program was built with the simplest  idea for completing registration and login in. The user is required to fill out details and make choices. 

The major challenge in this program was the aspect ratio problems in tkinter on various operations systems. 
This program runs and looks smooth on both Unix (Mac OS) and Linux systems, however, there are several inconsistencies with the buttons, boxes and labels among others in windows. 
Currently, there is no fix.
